            Growing up, I was the kid who wanted to try everything. From taking dancing and art classes to gymnastics, to playing voleyball and horse riding, I spent my childhood chasing whatever sparked my curiosity. I wasn't staying busy, I was just addicted to the "click" that happens when you finally master a new skill. 
        </div>

        <div class="bio-paragraph">
            This curiosity eventually found a home in the world of logic. Through my grandfather’s scholarly talks, I fell in love with science. Math became my favorite puzzle; there was a unique sense of satisfaction in solving a complex problem. To push myself further, I dove into the 
            <span class="highlight">Republic Olympiads</span>—starting from scratch and securing a 
            <span class="highlight">bronze medal</span> after only five months of intense preparation.
        </div>

        <div class="bio-paragraph">
            While I was mastering the language of math, I was also mastering the language of the world. I spent three years obsessively studying English, and earning an 
            <span class="highlight">IELTS 8.0</span> was simply the product of my dedication. My interest in physics and chemistry also grew  deep and I decided to take the state center exams—not for admission, but to test my skills in science. Scoring 
            <span class="highlight">above 600</span> confirmed what I already knew: I loved the challenge of science-heavy subjects.

    I carry that same <strong>"explorer’s mindset"</strong> into my code today. I believe that being a great developer isn't just about logic, it’s about having the curiosity to try everything, the grit to master the difficult, and the belief that the next "impossible" problem is just another chance to find satisfaction.
